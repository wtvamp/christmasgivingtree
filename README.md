Christmas Giving Tree
===================

This is a quick and simple demo of an animated Christmas Giving Tree from early 2010.  It requires a simple 1 table DB backend, two small ASPX web forms, and a significant amount of jQuery.  The app was designed to be IE7 compliant, but uses modernizer to do some new things if possible.  This was my first step towards HTML5 migration, but was built for an enterprise stuck in IE6 world at the time.
